  <h2>My Actual First Website</h2>
    <p>Right so I'm just gonna try a few tags here and there. You know.
      Whatever I learn from youtube and the IIT course, which by the way is
      actually very helpful even if I'm way behind in the course. Right.
      Getting back to the topic, I'm gonna try out the 'strong' tag
      for bold and the 'em' tag for italics. Oh yea. Can't forget about
      the 'ul' tag for unordered lists and the 'ol' tag for ordered lists with
      a mix  of 'hr' which stands for horizontal line... Ok, I think this
      paragraph is big enough now. Lol.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ok so this is basically my second paragraph to check how the spacing
  between paragraphs work. But also this will be my excuse to introduce some
  lists. So yea that's there...
    </p>
    <ul>
    <h4>The tags I'm gonna use are: </h4>
    <li>Bold</li>
    <li>Italics</li>
    <li>Hmmmm...</li>
    <li>Nothing else really</li>
    </ul>
   <hr/>
    <ol>
    <h4>So now for some pokemon cuz why not :D</h4>
    <li>Pikachu...duh
    <li>Metagross
    <li>On a completely unrelated note, I love how I met your mother!!!
    </ol>
